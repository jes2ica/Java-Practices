			<td></li></ul><p class='stagedir'><a name='1'></a>Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA,]
[p]and LAFEU, all in black]
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Countess. </strong><a name='3'></a>In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Bertram. </strong><a name='4'></a>And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death
<br>anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to
 <span class='playlinenum'>5</span><br>whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Lafeu. </strong><a name='7'></a>You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,
<br>sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times
<br>good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose
<br>worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather
 <span class='playlinenum'>10</span><br>than lack it where there is such abundance.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Countess. </strong><a name='12'></a>What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Lafeu. </strong><a name='13'></a>He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose
<br>practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and
<br>finds no other advantage in the process but only the
 <span class='playlinenum'>15</span><br>losing of hope by time.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Countess. </strong><a name='17'></a>This young gentlewoman had a father,&mdash;O, that
<br>'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!&mdash;whose skill was
<br>almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so
<br>far, would have made nature immortal, and death
 <span class='playlinenum'>20</span><br>should have play for lack of work. Would, for the
<br>king's sake, he were living! I think it would be
<br>the death of the king's disease.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Lafeu. </strong><a name='24'></a>How called you the man you speak of, madam?
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Countess. </strong><a name='25'></a>He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was
 <span class='playlinenum'>25</span><br>his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Lafeu. </strong><a name='27'></a>He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very
<br>lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he
<br>was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge
<br>could be set up against mortality.
 <span class='playlinenum'>30</span></li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Bertram. </strong><a name='31'></a>What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Lafeu. </strong><a name='32'></a>A fistula, my lord.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Bertram. </strong><a name='33'></a>I heard not of it before.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Lafeu. </strong><a name='34'></a>I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman
<br>the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?
 <span class='playlinenum'>35</span></li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Countess. </strong><a name='36'></a>His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my
<br>overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that
<br>her education promises; her dispositions she
<br>inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where
<br>an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there
 <span class='playlinenum'>40</span><br>commendations go with pity; they are virtues and
<br>traitors too; in her they are the better for their
<br>simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Lafeu. </strong><a name='44'></a>Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Countess. </strong><a name='45'></a>'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise
 <span class='playlinenum'>45</span><br>in. The remembrance of her father never approaches
<br>her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all
<br>livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;
<br>go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect
<br>a sorrow than have it.
 <span class='playlinenum'>50</span></li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Helena. </strong><a name='51'></a>I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Lafeu. </strong><a name='52'></a>Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,
<br>excessive grief the enemy to the living.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Countess. </strong><a name='54'></a>If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess
<br>makes it soon mortal.
 <span class='playlinenum'>55</span></li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Bertram. </strong><a name='56'></a>Madam, I desire your holy wishes.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Lafeu. </strong><a name='57'></a>How understand we that?
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Countess. </strong><a name='58'></a>Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father
<br>In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue
<br>Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
 <span class='playlinenum'>60</span><br>Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,
<br>Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy
<br>Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
<br>Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,
<br>But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,
 <span class='playlinenum'>65</span><br>That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,
<br>Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;
<br>'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,
<br>Advise him.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Lafeu. </strong><a name='70'></a>He cannot want the best
 <span class='playlinenum'>70</span><br>That shall attend his love.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Countess. </strong><a name='72'></a>Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.
</li></ul>

</li></ul><p class='stagedir'><a name='73'></a>[Exit]
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Bertram. </strong><a name='74'></a><i>[To HELENA]</i> The best wishes that can be forged in
<br>your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable
 <span class='playlinenum'>75</span><br>to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Lafeu. </strong><a name='77'></a>Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of
<br>your father.
</li></ul>

</li></ul><p class='stagedir'><a name='79'></a>[Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU]
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Helena. </strong><a name='80'></a>O, were that all! I think not on my father;
 <span class='playlinenum'>80</span><br>And these great tears grace his remembrance more
<br>Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
<br>I have forgot him: my imagination
<br>Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
<br>I am undone: there is no living, none,
 <span class='playlinenum'>85</span><br>If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
<br>That I should love a bright particular star
<br>And think to wed it, he is so above me:
<br>In his bright radiance and collateral light
<br>Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
 <span class='playlinenum'>90</span><br>The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
<br>The hind that would be mated by the lion
<br>Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,
<br>To see him every hour; to sit and draw
<br>His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
 <span class='playlinenum'>95</span><br>In our heart's table; heart too capable
<br>Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:
<br>But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
<br>Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?
<br><i>[Enter PAROLLES]</i>
 <span class='playlinenum'>100</span><br><i>[Aside]</i>
<br>One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;
<br>And yet I know him a notorious liar,
<br>Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;
<br>Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,
 <span class='playlinenum'>105</span><br>That they take place, when virtue's steely bones
<br>Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see
<br>Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Parolles. </strong><a name='109'></a>Save you, fair queen!
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Helena. </strong><a name='110'></a>And you, monarch!
 <span class='playlinenum'>110</span></li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Parolles. </strong><a name='111'></a>No.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Helena. </strong><a name='112'></a>And no.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Parolles. </strong><a name='113'></a>Are you meditating on virginity?
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Helena. </strong><a name='114'></a>Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me
<br>ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how
 <span class='playlinenum'>115</span><br>may we barricado it against him?
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Parolles. </strong><a name='117'></a>Keep him out.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Helena. </strong><a name='118'></a>But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,
<br>in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some
<br>warlike resistance.
 <span class='playlinenum'>120</span></li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Parolles. </strong><a name='121'></a>There is none: man, sitting down before you, will
<br>undermine you and blow you up.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Helena. </strong><a name='123'></a>Bless our poor virginity from underminers and
<br>blowers up! Is there no military policy, how
<br>virgins might blow up men?
 <span class='playlinenum'>125</span></li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Parolles. </strong><a name='126'></a>Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be
<br>blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with
<br>the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It
<br>is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to
<br>preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational
 <span class='playlinenum'>130</span><br>increase and there was never virgin got till
<br>virginity was first lost. That you were made of is
<br>metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost
<br>may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is
<br>ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!
 <span class='playlinenum'>135</span></li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Helena. </strong><a name='136'></a>I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Parolles. </strong><a name='137'></a>There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the
<br>rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,
<br>is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible
<br>disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:
 <span class='playlinenum'>140</span><br>virginity murders itself and should be buried in
<br>highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate
<br>offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,
<br>much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very
<br>paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.
 <span class='playlinenum'>145</span><br>Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of
<br>self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the
<br>canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose
<br>by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make
<br>itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the
 <span class='playlinenum'>150</span><br>principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Helena. </strong><a name='152'></a>How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Parolles. </strong><a name='153'></a>Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it
<br>likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with
<br>lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't
 <span class='playlinenum'>155</span><br>while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.
<br>Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out
<br>of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just
<br>like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not
<br>now. Your date is better in your pie and your
 <span class='playlinenum'>160</span><br>porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,
<br>your old virginity, is like one of our French
<br>withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,
<br>'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;
<br>marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?
 <span class='playlinenum'>165</span></li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Helena. </strong><a name='166'></a>Not my virginity yet <i>[&mdash;]</i>
<br>There shall your master have a thousand loves,
<br>A mother and a mistress and a friend,
<br>A phoenix, captain and an enemy,
<br>A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
 <span class='playlinenum'>170</span><br>A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;
<br>His humble ambition, proud humility,
<br>His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,
<br>His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world
<br>Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,
 <span class='playlinenum'>175</span><br>That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he&mdash;
<br>I know not what he shall. God send him well!
<br>The court's a learning place, and he is one&mdash;
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Parolles. </strong><a name='179'></a>What one, i' faith?
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Helena. </strong><a name='180'></a>That I wish well. 'Tis pity&mdash;
 <span class='playlinenum'>180</span></li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Parolles. </strong><a name='181'></a>What's pity?
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Helena. </strong><a name='182'></a>That wishing well had not a body in't,
<br>Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,
<br>Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,
<br>Might with effects of them follow our friends,
 <span class='playlinenum'>185</span><br>And show what we alone must think, which never
<br>Return us thanks.

</li></ul><p class='stagedir'><a name='190'></a>[Exit]
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Parolles. </strong><a name='191'></a>Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I
<br>will think of thee at court.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Helena. </strong><a name='193'></a>Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Parolles. </strong><a name='194'></a>Under Mars, I.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Helena. </strong><a name='195'></a>I especially think, under Mars.
 <span class='playlinenum'>195</span></li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Parolles. </strong><a name='196'></a>Why under Mars?
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Helena. </strong><a name='197'></a>The wars have so kept you under that you must needs
<br>be born under Mars.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Parolles. </strong><a name='199'></a>When he was predominant.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Helena. </strong><a name='200'></a>When he was retrograde, I think, rather.
 <span class='playlinenum'>200</span></li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Parolles. </strong><a name='201'></a>Why think you so?
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Helena. </strong><a name='202'></a>You go so much backward when you fight.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Parolles. </strong><a name='203'></a>That's for advantage.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Helena. </strong><a name='204'></a>So is running away, when fear proposes the safety;
<br>but the composition that your valour and fear makes
 <span class='playlinenum'>205</span><br>in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Parolles. </strong><a name='207'></a>I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee
<br>acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the
<br>which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize
<br>thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's
 <span class='playlinenum'>210</span><br>counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon
<br>thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and
<br>thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When
<br>thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast
<br>none, remember thy friends; get thee a good husband,
 <span class='playlinenum'>215</span><br>and use him as he uses thee; so, farewell.
</li></ul>

</li></ul><p class='stagedir'><a name='217'></a>[Exit]
</li></ul>

<ul><li class='playtext'><strong>Helena. </strong><a name='218'></a>Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,
<br>Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky
<br>Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull
 <span class='playlinenum'>220</span><br>Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.
<br>What power is it which mounts my love so high,
<br>That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
<br>The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
<br>To join like likes and kiss like native things.
 <span class='playlinenum'>225</span><br>Impossible be strange attempts to those
<br>That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose
<br>What hath been cannot be: who ever strove
<br>So show her merit, that did miss her love?
<br>The king's disease&mdash;my project may deceive me,
 <span class='playlinenum'>230</span><br>But my intents are fix'd and will not leave me.
